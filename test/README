CPPTRAJ: Trajectory analysis based on Ptraj, written in C++.
Daniel R. Roe 2010

This directory contains tests which check most of the functionality of cpptraj.
By default tests are run using ../bin/cpptraj.

To run tests, type 'make test'. To run tests with memory checking (requires
valgrind installed and in path), type 'make test.vg'. Any individual test
can be run by itself by changing to the test directory and typing 
'./RunTest.sh'.

By default STDOUT from each test is redirected to 'test.out'. If valgrind is
used STDERR is redirected to 'valgrind.out'. Test results are summarized in
Test_Results.dat.

Note that all $TESTDIR/RunTest.sh tests require and depend on the existence of 
MasterTest.sh, which sets up the run environment for each test in a consistent
way.

ADDITIONAL MISC. INFO:
There are several coordinate/topology files in the main directory since they
are used by several tests:

2JJY-chainA-all.parm7 + md.nc: 
  20 frames of FtuFabI, no solvent.
trpcage.*: 
  Trpcage, no solvent. trpcage.nc, trpcage.crd, and trpcage.crd.gz contain the 
  same 101 frames. trpcage.pdb and trpcage.rst7 contain the first frame.
ChainA-tip3p.parm7, run0.nc, ptraj.run0.crd:
  10 frames of FtuFabI in TIP3P solvent, truncated oct. box.
DPDP:
  100 frames of DPDP, no solvent.

Several tests contain their own crd/top files as well.
