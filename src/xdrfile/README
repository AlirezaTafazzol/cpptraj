This library allows to read GROMACS trr and xtc files and also to
convert from one format to another.

The library itself is offered under the BSD license, which means you are free
to incorporate it any way you want in other libraries or executables, no
matter what the final license is.

NOTE: This is a compact version of this library adapted by DRR for use in
      CPPTRAJ. Any issues resulting from this port are not the responsibility
      of the original authors.
