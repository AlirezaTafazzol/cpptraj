/**
SPAM is a water profiling technique developed by Guanglei Cui at
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The original implementation involved a set of specialized
Python scripts interacting with VMD (via the VolMap tool), numpy, NAMD (for the
SPAM energy calculations) and R (for the free energy calculation using a
specialized kernel density estimate). While that implementation demonstrated
proof of principle, simply re-ordering the trajectory for use with NAMD proved
to be a performance bottleneck because it was written in Python. SPAM was
rewritten from the ground up in cpptraj, significantly improving efficiency and
providing a simpler interface.

The original C++ implementation of SPAM in cpptraj was done by Jason Swails
while interning at GSK. This code was built as a patch on top of cpptraj v.12
and was rewritten by Jason Swails for the current cpptraj version.
